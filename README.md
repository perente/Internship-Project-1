# Internship-Project-1
This repo contains my internship project completed in the IT department at Fakir Hausger√§te.

I designed a front-end interface of a sales records system with CSS and JavaScript components during my internship. The project was built using Tailwind CSS, focusing on a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design. It included interactive UI components without a backend integration.
